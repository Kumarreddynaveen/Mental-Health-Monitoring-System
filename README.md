I developed an AI-based mental health monitoring system using Reinforcement Learning (DQN) to analyze employee well-being in workplace environments. 
The project includes an api.py file that serves as the backend interface, handling real-time data input and delivering prediction outputs through API endpoints.
A dedicated preprocessing module cleans and transforms the raw sensor and behavioral data—such as heart rate, activity logs, and workplace interferece—into a structured format suitable for model inference. 
The system utilizes a curated dataset for training and validation, and generates visual outputs including stress level graphs, behavioral trends, and personalized recommendations for mental health improvement, promoting timely interventions and overall workplace productivity.
